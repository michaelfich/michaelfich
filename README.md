### Hi there 👋

I'm a Software Developer based in Toronto, Canada for the past 10 years.

I've had the opportunity to work with multiple technologies ranging from front-end development, back-end development and operations. These days, I'm working primarily with Elixir and Phoenix but I have extensive experience with Ruby on Rails, Ember.js, React.js and a variety of other frameworks and programming languages.  I've also worked to build cloud networks in both Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Platform.
